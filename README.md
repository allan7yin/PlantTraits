### Goal:
Our goal is to predict a broad set of 6 plant traits (e.g. leaf area, plant height) from crowd-sourced plant images and some ancillary data. 

### Why Does It Matter?
Plants are the superheroes of our ecosystems. Their traits hold the key to understanding ecosystems, e.g., in terms of their diversity, productivity, or how these green heroes face the challenges brought on by climate change. This project aims to contribute to our understanding of how plants navigate the complexities of climate change.
